Overriding main() method in java?
Whenever we do inheritance in java then if a method in subclass has the same name and type signature
 as a method in its parent class or superclass, then it is said that the method in subclass is overriding
  the method of parent class. Method overriding is one of the way that java supports run time Polymorphism.
No, we cannot override main method of java because a static method cannot be overridden.
The static method in java is associated with class whereas the non-static method is associated with an object.
 Static belongs to the class area, static methods donâ€™t need an object to be called. Static methods can be called
  directly by using the classname ( classname.static_method_name() ).
So, whenever we try to execute the derived class static method, it will automatically execute the base class static method.
